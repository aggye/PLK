<p class="homepage-blurb">The Regiment's lineage dates back to the Kensington Volunteers of 1798 raised to protect Kensington in case of invasion by Napoleon the first.
The Haldane reforms of 1908 disbanded the old Volunteer units and thus the 13th County of London Regiment was formed. In the same year HRH Princess Louise who resided at Kensington Palace gave her consent to the use of her name to the new Regiment. 
The Regiment went on to distinguish itself during both World Wars and in the Post War / Cold War era.
Over the past 100 years the Regiment has fulfilled many roles from a front-line infantry regiment in the Great War 1914-18, to a Machine Gun Regiment in the Second World War 1939-45.
In 1947 the Regiment was re-badged into the Royal Corps of Signals as a Phantom Signal Regiment. The Regiment was downsized to a Squadron in 1967 and again in 2013 to a Troop as part of 31 (Mx Yeo and PLK) Signal Squadron in 71st (City of London) Yeomanry Signal Regiment – a high tech signals and communications Regiment.  In this role it continues to support the regular army and our country's commitment to NATO.
