<p>PLKRA NEWSLETTER MAY 2023</p>

<p>Dear Members,

[Introduction by the Chairman]



AGM
We had a successful Zoom AGM on 23 March at which Bob Simpson announced his intention to step down as Chairman at the lunch on 15 April. He expressed gratitude to the Committee and Members for the support he had received during his tenure and welcomed Debbie Wilkinson who would be taking over the Chair.  He felt that the highlight of last year was the publication of the new history of the Kensingtons written by Ray Tattle and that it was important to keep the pressure on sales in the future. The Committee remains intact: 
Brig John Kendall - President
Capt (Retd) Debbie Wilkinson - Chairman
Maj (Ret'd) Jim Mill – Treasurer
Ray Tattle - Historian
Maj (Ret'd) Bob Simpson
Maj (Ret'd) Jim Allan
Maj Phil Jones – OC 31 (MY and PLK) Signal Squadron
WO2 (SSM) Simon May
Maurice Byrne
Rob Watson
Cpl Robin Young
Ian North

ANNUAL LUNCH
Another success was the annual lunch held jointly with 31 SRA on 15 April at which Bob duly stepped down and Debbie took over the Chair. It was enjoyed by our guests – the Mayor of the RBKC, his wife and the RDL. The feedback from Members was that lunches, as opposed to evening dinners, were the way forward and the next annual lunch, again with 31SRA,  has been arranged for 20 April 2024 at the Union Jack Club. He had continued keeping members posted by means of brief Newsletters but felt that they could be improved by stories/anecdotes from members.

ACCOUNTS
The net worth of the Association's General Fund at 31/12/2022 was £9,909 after allowing for book sales receipts of £1,270 due to Ray Tattle. This Fund had benefited from an injection of £1,438 in 2022 from the sales, arranged by Ray Tattle, of pictures which used to adorn the drill hall and which the committee felt were no longer needed. He is also investigating the marketing of the collection of military cartoons which we hold in the Display Room at Coulsdon ARC.
The net worth of the Charitable Trust Fund at 31/12/2022 was £7,670


 CITIZEN SOLDIERS
Income from the sales of  the history of the Kensingtons book will be transferred to Ray, the author, until such time as he has recovered the cost of printing and marketing them. This is why it is important to take whatever opportunities there are to sell them. Ray has arranged with the RBKC library to do a face-to-face + Zoom presentation about the history of the Kensingtons to try to raise interest in the book; but if you can spread the word about the book (flyers are available from me) or consider purchasing a copy (available by contacting me) this would be very helpful.

WEB SITE
We are taking steps to get the web-site up and running and publicised. This will give us a vital link to members, potential members and the public in general with up to date material such as these Newsletter and notices of the AGM and annual lunch. 

LE HAVRE
In 2003 a group of 12  Association members went to Le Havre to dedicate a PLKR plaque on the 49 (WR) Division “Atlantic Wall” Memorial commemorating those who gave up their lives during the relief of Le Havre in September 1944. Each year since then a group of PLKRA members has visited Le Havre to lay a wreath at the memorial in a ceremony arranged by the Mayor of  Fontaine-la-Mallet, the village hosting the memorial, in conjunction with the Remember 8 September 1944 Association. We also lay a wreath at the civilian memorial commemorating the civilians who died in the barrage preceding the battle. There is an optional church service after which we are invited to the Mayor's parlour for liquid refreshments.
Our group has diminished in numbers over the years and so far this year we have 4 volunteers for the visit over the weekend of 8 – 11 September. We carshare (sharing the ferry costs etc) and besides the remembrance activities there is scope and time for other things to do. If you would like to join us please let the Hon Sec know.

 YPRES 
A small group from the PLKRA visited Ypres in 2017 to place and dedicate a PLKR memorial plaque on the wall of the Baptistry in St John's church. The walls are covered with plaques of nearly all the Units involved in the Battle of the Somme. Every year since then a small party of Members has returned to Ypres to lay a wreath at our memorial. Again we carshare so afterwards we can visit a local war cemetery or anything else the group wish to  do. But in the evening we attend the Last Post ceremony at the Menin Gate followed by a meal in one of the local excellent restaurants. We have not yet arranged a date for this year's visit but please let the Hon Sec know if you're interested in joining us and he'll send you the details when available.

OTHER EVENTS
For your diary/calendar you may like to note the following dates/events.
Sunday 17 September – RHC parade and lunch – open to all members of the Corps

NEWSLETTERS
 The main objective of these Newsletters is to keep members up to speed with dates and timings of our activities but it is the intention of the Committee to include a History Supplement to forthcoming editions the first of which is included in this issue. The editor would like to hear of any recollections that passed or serving members have had during their service, in particular during the post war and cold war period. Feel free to let me or our historian, Ray Tattle – raytattle@gmail.com -  have any (publishable) material. 
Have  good summer,


Steve
